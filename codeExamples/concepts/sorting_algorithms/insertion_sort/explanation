This is very similar to how you sort cards in your hand.

Imagine you have 2 sections, a sorted and unsorted section.

For each item in the unsorted section, you look if the next value is hihger or lower than those in the sorted section and place it appropriately.

[11, 12, 13, 5, 6] <-- initial array
[11, 12, 13, 5, 6]

[5, 11, 12, 13, 6]
[5, 6, 11, 12, 13]
