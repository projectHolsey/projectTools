Another way to traverse a graph

Depth first is going to check each left node first.
if there's no left node, it'll traverse the last added right node

Example.

            1
           / \
          2   3
         /   / \
        4   6   5
       /   / \   \
      7   9   8   10

The order this will be traversed is as follows:

1  <-- start
2  <-- go left first
5
7
3  <-- nothing left to traverse on left, so go to last added right
6
9
8
5
10
