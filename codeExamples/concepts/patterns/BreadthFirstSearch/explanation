This is a way to traverse a graph

In breadth first, you traverse horizontally before traversing vertically.

For this, typically, you use a queue to push and pop the 'visited' nodes of the graph.

Example.

            1
           / \
          2   3
         /   / \
        4   6   5
       /   / \   \
      7   9   8   10

The order you would traverse is as follows.

1       <-- Gives you nodes 2 & 3 to visit next
2       <-- Add node 4 to the queue
3       <-- Adds nodes 5 and 6 to the queue
4
6       <-- 6 is the next horizontal node to visit, not 5
5
7
9       <-- Same here, 9 is first, not 8
8
10

Once here, you'll have mapped the entire tree.
